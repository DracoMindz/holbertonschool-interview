## Tasks

***0. Slide line mandatory***

The goal of this task is to reproduce the 2048 game(NSFW !!) mechanics on a single horizontal line.

---
Given an array of integers, we want to be able to slide & merge it to the left or to the right. Identical numbers, if they are contiguous or separated by zeros, should be merged.
