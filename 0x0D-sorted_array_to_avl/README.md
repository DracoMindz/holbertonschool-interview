Specializations - Interview Preparation â€• Algorithms

### Tasks

***0. AVL - From sorted array***

```
1. Prototype: avl_t *sorted_array_to_avl(int *array, size_t size);

2. Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to be converted

3. And size is the number of element in the array

4. Your function must return a pointer to the root node of the created AVL tree, or NULL on failure
