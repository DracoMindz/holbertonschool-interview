# 0x17. Find the Loop
Specializations Interview Preparation Algorithms

## Tasks

**0. Find the loop**
___
Write a function that finds the loop in a linked list. Not allowed to use: printf, malloc, free or arrays. Can declare a maximum of two variables.
Prototype: listint_t *find_listint_loop(listint_t *head);

Note: If you remember the story of the tortoise and the hare, one being fast and the other being slow, you may recall how to write this code.  It is based on a Floyd Algorithm.
