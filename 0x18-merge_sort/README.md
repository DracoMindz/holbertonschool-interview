# 0x18 Merge Sort
Specilizations - Interview Preparation - Algorithms

Given a print_arry function for this project.

With projects written in C a header file is required.
No more than five functons are allowed per file.

### Task
 0. Merge Sort
___
Write a function that sorts a array of integers in
ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.
Prototype: void nerge_sort(int *array, size_t size)

For this project top-dpwn merge sort algorithm is
required.

Allowed: printf, malloc and free (once)
___

0-O
___
Write Big O notations of time complexity of the
Merge Sort:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
___

Note:
```
There is a solution to this using mallloc and free.

After the function ran: correctly sorting the array and putting the contents of the array in ascending order; I reread the main. I added printf and print_array statements to match the output of the main. I ran the function again to verify the output I was reciving coinsided with the output in the main.
